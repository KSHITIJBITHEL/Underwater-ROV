# Underwater-ROV for inspection of Head Race Tunnels in Hydro-electric Power plants

**<ins>Disclaimer</ins>** : This repository contains the information and code for the underwater robot developed by Team Epsilon from IIT Roorkee for competing in the PS-Id PK365 by Ministry of Power, Govt. of India hosted in the Smart India Hackathon 2020 : Hardware Edition 

### <ins>Introduction</ins> 
Large scale civil structures like dams require periodic inspections due to their safety-critical nature. In Hydro-electric Plants, monitoring and upkeep of Head Race Tunnels(HRTs) is such a critcial task for proper operation of the plant, especially in Himalayan rivers which carry huge silt. Head race tunnels connect the reservior(intake) to the power geneation unit (as shown in Fig1) and are susceptible to erosion and debris collection which can lead to even collapse of the whole structure <sup>[[1]](http://www.rockmass.net/files/Vinstra_collapse.pdf)</sup>. Traditionally, the process of inspecting headrace tunnels involves manual labour and requires the tunnel to be emptied, which is a cumbersome process with high inspection cost. Using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) capable of inspecting the structure underwater would result in a considerable decrease in the inspection turn-around-time and cost, and therefore, a robot is designed to cater these requirements and a hardware prototype is built demonstrating the effectiveness of approach.

### <ins>Design Considerations</ins>
According to the problem statement<sup>[[2]](https://github.com/robinsdeepak/SIH-2020-PS)</sup>, the main concerns accessed during the inspection of HRTs include the deposition of silt/debris, cracking/deformation of tunnel walls and erosion of electronic and mechanical componects due to high acidity in water.
